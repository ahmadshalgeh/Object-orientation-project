# Object-orientation-project
A program in which there is a football class that inherits characteristics from the human class.
The program is to first create 22 football objects, then assign the following player names to each object. Using the random and inheritance method, it divides the 22 names between teams A and B, and finally prints the name of each player with the name of the team on which it is located.                                                                   
                                                                                                                        
Names of players:
